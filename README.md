# iHipsterJS Web Application Framework

Simple and fast JavaScript Web Framework for real Hipsters. 
This JavaScript Framework is unique, different and totally cool. 

Just like Hipsters. 

Works best on Macbook Pro.


Here is the simplest example how to display remote data on your page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My remote data</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <template>
      <ul>
        ${async () => this.template.forEach(await(await fetch("/endpoint/")).json(), value => `
          <li>
              ${value}
          </li>
        `)}
       </ul>
    </template>

    <script src="ihjs.js"></script>

  </body>
</html>
```

Pretty unique, isn't it. It's all just JavaScript.

> **WARNING:** Framework is under construction.
